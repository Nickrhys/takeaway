TAKEAWAY
========

Working with different classes to create a function for ordering food using Ruby. This programme allows a customer to order dishes of different quantities from a menu. The takeaway will then send the customer a text message that confirms the customer's name, the price of the order and that their order will be with them within an hour of the time it was ordered.
